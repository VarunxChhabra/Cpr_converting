Ans 1 - The three functions which I have created for this milestone are 
 1)- void viewAllAppointments(struct ClinicData* data)
 This function is used to list all the appointments of the patients that are scheduled in the system. This will list the list of the patients according to
 the time and date at which the appointment is scheduled which also includes information regarding the patient number, name, phone number, and date and time 
 of the appointment. Moreover, with the help of this function customers can view, reschedule or cancel their fixed appointments

2)- void addAppointment(struct Appointment *appointments, int maxAppointments, struct Patient *patients, int maxPatient)
 This function is used to add appointments for the patients first it will check through the array that the maximum number of
 patients haven't reached yet if yes it shows the message that the time slot is not available and if yes it will ask for the details such as the
 patient number and time slot there is a preferred time slot if the user didn't enter the time in preferred it shows the error message after that 
 the program will check if the entered slot is available if yes it will book the appointment.

3)- sortingAppoint(appointments, size)
 This function is used to sort the list of appointments by checking the appointments array and sorting it in ascending order by checking the 
 date and time of the appointment.

Ans 2 - I use 90 lines of the code for the "addAppointment" function and it nearly saves more than hundreds of line after applying the pattern recognition
 and different functions. The sections of different logic which I am able to consolidate into the function are listed below 
 
1)- checkLeapYear(&appointments[size].date);
 This function is used to validate that the date and time stored by the function "addAppointment" and if they are not valid it prompts the user to re-enter 
 the value for taking an appointment. Moreover, it also checks whether the year mentioned in the date is a leap year or not if it is the leap year it adjusts the 
 dates for the month of February accordingly.

2)- size = calculateSizeOfAppointmentsArray(appointments, maxAppointments);
 This function is used to check if there any space left in the appointment array for new appointments. This was not the complex one that need to consolidate into
 the function. I did this so because it is used in many parts of the code.So, to make it comfortable for the reader and main the maintainability of the code I consolidate
 it into the function.

Ans 3 - I started this milestone after the class only on Tuesday only because somewhere in the back of my mind I know that it was going to be hard for this as I need to combine 
        all the code and if I get an error I need to debug the whole code so divided my work on Tuesday only as there were 4 functions that I need to make and also 1 reflection 
        So on Tuesday I went through all the basic and debug milestone 2 and prepare the plan for doing the further work. On Wednesday I devoted the night time to function 1 
        "viewAllAppointments" function, which was quite easy for me and I did it at the same night I also started with the next function viewAppointmentSchedule and that was also I 
         did it. However, it takes a longer time for me than usual which might be because I was checking each and every step again and again. On Thursday I started with the third and fourth
         functions this is where I found trouble in writing the code. I got confused for leapyear function and in iterations too but somehow I managed it by asking help from my friends
         for function 4 I found trouble in sorting for that I connected with my friends and we solved that error. It took me three days for completing the code on Sunday I did my reflection 
         but when I debug the code on Sunday get an error in core.c in inputCharOption(const char str[]) function after analyzing the function I made it error-free within 30 mins.
